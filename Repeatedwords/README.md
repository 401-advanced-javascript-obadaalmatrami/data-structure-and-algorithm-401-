# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Repeat Word
We will be creating a function that returns the first repeat word

<!-- Description of the challenge -->
The challenge entails create a function that takes a string and returns the first repeat word in that string
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

Removed punctuation then split each word, looped through array of words and set that works as the key in an object and set its count to 1, once the loop gets a word that has already been set as a key, it will return that word.

Big O()
Time O(n)
Space O(1)
