# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
we will create a function that allow us to check two key values if the keys have the same name
after that we will using the hashtable we created before to instanciate the new hash-table 
## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
how we can loop inside the hash table 
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
BIG O()

time : O(n)
Space : O(1)
## API
